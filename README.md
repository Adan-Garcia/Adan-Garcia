# 👋 Hi, I'm Adan Garcia

I'm a self-taught developer who works primarily with **Godot (GDScript)** and **Python**. I build games and systems for fun, learning, and the occasional obsession.

## 🛠️ Tools & Focus
- 💻 **Languages:** GDScript, Python  
- 🕹️ **Engine:** Godot  
- 🧩 **Projects:** Primarily game development (text-based systems, AI-assisted narratives)

---

## 🎮 Currently Working On
**Untitled Chronicle** — a narrative-driven MMO where the dungeon master is AI.  
Think: persistent world, permadeath, and dynamic storytelling through structured player actions.
